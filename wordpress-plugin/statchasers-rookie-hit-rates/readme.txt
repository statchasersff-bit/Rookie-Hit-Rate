Embed the StatChasers Rookie Hit Rates dynasty analytics tool with a shortcode.

== Description ==

Drop the interactive Rookie Hit Rates tool into any page, post, or "Code" module
with a single shortcode:

    [rookie_hit_rates]

The entire application (charts, filters, data) is bundled with the plugin and runs
in an isolated iframe, so it never conflicts with your theme's CSS or JavaScript.
No external server, database, or API is required — all data ships inside the plugin.

= Shortcode attributes =

* `height` — initial iframe height in px before auto-resize (default 1400)
* `min_height` — minimum iframe height in px (default 600)
* `max_width` — max embed width in px, centered (default 1380; use 0 for full width)

Example:

    [rookie_hit_rates height="1500" max_width="0"]

The iframe automatically resizes to fit the tool's content as you switch tabs.

== Installation ==

1. In WordPress admin go to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin.
2. Choose statchasers-rookie-hit-rates.zip and click Install Now.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Add [rookie_hit_rates] to any page, post, or Code module.
